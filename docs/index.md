# Welcome to the PyDST documentation


## Installation
To install PyDST simply clone [the repository](https://github.com/Kristianuruplarsen/PyDST), then open your terminal/command prompt
and use `cd` to navigate to the root folder of the repo (e.g. C:/Users/USER_NAME/Documents/github/PyDST on most windows machines).
while _in_ the root of the repo, run `pip install .` (or `python setup.py install`).


## Documentation
* [connecting to the API](connection)
* [mapping](map)



## Small notes for the curious
* Do not make your documentation in this way. It is a lot to maintain, and Sphinx can probably do it better. I'm only doing this because PyDST is a relatively simple, and i don't have time to learn Sphinx.
